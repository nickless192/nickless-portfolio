# My Portfolio

## Description
As required by the employer, I have put together my initial portfolio showchasing my progress so far as part of the Coding Bootcamp program.

Upon reviewing the code and evaluating the site, the reviewer will evidence the use of flexbox, variables, media queries, pseudo-classes, as well as other concepts that were taught during the first module of class.

## User Story

AS AN employer <br />
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples<br />
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position<br />

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work<br />
WHEN I load their portfolio<br />
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them<br />
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation<br />
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br />
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work<br />
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications<br />
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application<br />
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others<br />
WHEN I click on the images of the applications<br />
THEN I am taken to that deployed application<br />
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices<br />
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport<br />
